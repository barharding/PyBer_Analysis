# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Pyber is a ride-sharing company with over $2B in sales.  The purpose of this analysis is to develop a summary of the ride-share data by city type for the period of January to May 2019.  In addition, a visualization of the total weekly fares for each type will be developed.  Leveraging both the summary data and visualizations this report will show the differences by city type in PyBer ride-share data.  


## Results
Before summarizing the results and drawing conclusions about the results it is important to list what we don't know about the data which might skew the observations.  For example, fares for ride-sharing services are based on distance and duration this is likely common for each city type but it is entirely possible that the prices applied to this algorythm are different by city type.  This analysis will assume it is the same price.  In addition, ride-share services often provide a selection of service types like the options to select a Green trip, a luxury trip, economic trip etc... The prices would vary for each of these selections.  Again the analysis will assume it is the same price and that Pyber offers one service type in each city.

Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
